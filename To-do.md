# What is left to do?
To-do lists for Yacine and for Henrique

# Tentative submission date
10th of April 2024

## Yacine
- ~~Set the seed for the example~~
- ~~Add the seed (812) to the example~~
- ~~Re-do the figure (with the 06m instead of 6m)~~
- ~~Make the example file already preloaded into the package~~
- ~~Add examples on how to run the functions at the end of every function~~
- ~~Update the simulation script~~
- ~~Send screenshots~~
- ~~full_script input path to data OR a df already available.~~
- I am not sure it is currently in the ms, but the pipeline can take tabulation separated input file (.tsv) or comma separated input file (.csv) as input. I am mentionning that because a space separated input generates an error. We could include spaces as well but then if a label is called "Genus species" then that space is to confuse the pipeline as it's going to consider the two as two different columns. 
  
## Henrique
- ~~Send the Example file to Yacine~~
- ~~Download the package~~
- ~~Adjust the help files and re-write/tweak whatever is needed; send this back to Yacine~~

- ~~Suggest reviewers~~
- ~~Elaborate caption of Fig. 1~~
- ~~Elaborate caption of Fig. 2~~
- ~~Add extension of Fig. 2~~
- ~~Go through the manuscript~~
- Add code in the manuscript to load example file
- ~~Update manuscript to match the new figure~~

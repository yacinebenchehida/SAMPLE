\arguments{
\item{input}{Input dataframe (a dataframe object)}

\item{output_N}{Prefix used for the output (a character; default output_N="Results")}

\item{replicates}{Nnumber of permutation replicates to perform (an integer; default replicates=50)}

\item{stability_thres}{Threshold used to define stability (an integer). This value will be divided by the square root of the number of replicates (a float, default stability_thres = 2.0).}

\item{sucess_points}{Number of successive (mean) prevalence rates that are below a threshold (see parameter stability_thres) used to define stability (an integer; default stability_thres = 10).}

\item{diff}{Difference between the absolute minimum and maximum values among the all the means used to set the stability threshold (a float, default diff = 1.0).}
}
\value{
A textfile and a pdf.
